	Downsampling FIR Filter

	M is the decimation ratio
	N is the number of coefficients of the filter ( high sampling rate)
	L is the number of samples in the input vector

	The algorithm computes a convolution sum every M samples where M is the decimation
	ratio.\n
	An internal buffer keeps the N-1 last samples from the previous call. \n
	No copy of the input samples is made except for the last N-1.\n

	The algorithm performs well as long as the number of input samples to process is
	large compared to the number of coefficients of the filter.\n


	The user must make sure that the internal type is large enough to contain the
	accumulated sum of the convolution operation\n
	The user must make sure that the size of the input buffer is a multiple of M and that 
	the size of the output buffer is 1/M times the size of the input buffer.\n
	The output is always scaled to maintain a gain of between 0 and 6dB

	@param input Input to the filter
	@param filteredSignal Output of the filter. Must be the same size as signal
